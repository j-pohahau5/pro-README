# Pro README

## Description 

My motivation for this project was to build a README generator so I can be able to create a good structured README by just inputting the information to the question and not having to worry about structuring it. This challenge was pretty refreshing it got, but I did learn a lot through this process. I learned that you can't just put input where name is suppose to be, also that lo-fi music is a game changer when it comes down to studying. I feel that my project standouts because of me this was the first time i did the challenge Homework without needing a tutor.
